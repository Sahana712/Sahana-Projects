This project enhances video quality by generating intermediate frames between original ones using deep learning.
It leverages convolutional neural networks to predict motion and interpolate smooth transitions.
Designed to improve slow-motion playback and increase video frame rates intelligently.
Supports common video formats and uses PyTorch for model training and inference.
Offers a user-friendly interface to upload videos and view the interpolated output.
Optimized for performance with GPU acceleration and batch processing.


This project has been selected for presentation at ICCIDC 2025, Bali.
